# SentimentalWorld
Live sentiment analysis on Tweets about Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Ted Cruz leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Made using NLTK for Python and D3.js.

**Note**: On 2017-08-06 I stopped gathering tweets. The elections are long over and the project doesn't seem to result in anything interesting. Turns out it's difficult to capture sentiment in 140-character Tweets with a lot of political nuances in them. It was more interesting to see spikes in Tweets per second when certain events happened, but nothing much has been going on lately. Plus, it's eating up a *lot* of harddisk space by this point.
